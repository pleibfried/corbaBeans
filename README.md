# corbaBeans
Simplifies development of CORBA servers and clients using the Spring Framework

You need a JacORB installation (preferrably 3.9) on your system for testing/running the Corba Name Service.
The JacORB installation directory must be set accordingly in the properties section of pom.xml

All main classes are fully documented with JavaDoc.

This Readme will be expanded and improved soon.
